{"name":"exploring the ways of developer engagement","tagline":"Meeting, Creating and Enjoying","body":"Software development is getting mature in new forms of collaboration and engagement. Constant development opportunities can introduce questioning about personal pace and focus areas.\r\n\r\nPersonal experience is mostly gained by working as employee in software companies and external consulting for projects of others. Both types of engagement brought valuable experience to my personal career. Internal employment enabled deeper insight in complete organization arround software product. External consulting made me switch projects, approaches and technologies, meet people and travel.\r\n\r\nSoftware companies are more then willing to pay someone to get into projects that are making money. This kind of projects are usually not so interesting and on the other side they are challenging and bring professional experience. One thing that goes with this are daily office routines that makes me experience somehow inappropriate comparing to new development trends and progress of technologies.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, creativity is searching for new ways to be expresed. This keeps me looking forward. Freelancing is an open option for a while. Regarding previous impressions, this was a kind of battle to lower costs and grab projects to deliver and increase home budget. Never saw this as something professional. That was the experience from all those bids and projects offered via freelancing sites.\r\n\r\nThen, after a while, there was a different type of invitation in my mailbox. First impression was: this is kind a different, this looks professional. Mailbox contained invitation to join [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) site that hires top 3% of developers. After a while, this looked like something that is worth of mine attention so I intuitivly started filling out the entrance forms. The selection process is something that site is proud of. Seems that I will review my knowlege and get involved in some dojos as preparation for interview.\r\n\r\nThat was the talk, now lets walk.\r\nZoran","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
